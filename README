sfb-propertyeditors
===================

This small library has a few classes for everybody who is working with
PropertyEditors.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.SfbPropertyEditorSupport
---------------------------------------------------------

The SfbPropertyEditorSupport makes it easy to create your own
PropertyEditorSupport. You only have to provider a mapper that maps Strings
to objects. Listener support and storing of the value is already done by
SfbPropertyEditorSupport.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.SfbEnumEditor
----------------------------------------------

A SfbEnumEditor is a property editor for enums. The only difference to Java's
built-in editor is that it maps empty strings to null.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.PropertyEditorWithMapper
---------------------------------------------------------

An PropertyEditorWithMapper modifies the text input and output of another
PropertyEditor. A configurable mapper is used for the mapping.

When somebody calls setAsText(...) on the new editor, then it uses the mapper
to modify the text before it is supplied to the original PropertyEditor. The
same happens when somebody calls getAsText().

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.EnumEditor
----------------------------------------------

It is a replacement for Java's built-in enum editor. Java's editor is only an
internal class and therefore should not be used outside of Java. This class is
expected to be used by you.
