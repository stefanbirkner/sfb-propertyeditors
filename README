sfb-propertyeditors
===================

This small library has a few classes for everybody who is working with
PropertyEditors.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.SfbPropertyEditorSupport
---------------------------------------------------------

The SfbPropertyEditorSupport makes it easy to create your own
PropertyEditorSupport. You only have to override parseText(String).
Listener support and storing of the value is already done by
SfbPropertyEditorSupport.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.SfbEnumEditor
----------------------------------------------

A SfbEnumEditor is a property editor for enums. The only difference to Java's
built-in editor is that it maps empty strings to null.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.EmptyStringToNullEditor
--------------------------------------------------------

An EmptyStringToNullEditor is a wrapper for building PropertyEditors that
handle setAsText("") like setAsText(null).

Wrap the original editor with the EmptyStringToNullEditor:
  PropertyEditor wrappedEditor = new EmptyStringToNullEditor(originalEditor);

When somebody calls setAsText("") on the wrappedEditor, then it calls
setAsText(null) on the originalEditor. All other values and all other methods
are delegated to the originalEditor.

com.github.stefanbirkner.editors.EnumEditor
----------------------------------------------

It is a replacement for Java's built-in enum editor. Java's editor is only an
internal class and therefore should not be used outside of Java. This class is
expected to be used by you.
